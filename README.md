The `Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)` consists of sentences from movie reviews and human annotations of their sentiment. The task is to predict the `sentiment` of a given sentence. It uses the `two-way (positive 1 / negative 0)` class split, with only sentence-level labels. The following is a part of `train.tsv` from sst2 datasets.
